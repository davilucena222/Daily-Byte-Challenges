/* 
  This question is asked by Facebook. Given a linked list, containing unique values, reverse it, and return the result.

  Ex: Given the following linked lists...

  1->2->3->null, return a reference to the node that contains 3 which points to a list that looks like the following: 3->2->1->null
  7->15->9->2->null, return a reference to the node that contains 2 which points to a list that looks like the following: 2->9->15->7->null
  1->null, return a reference to the node that contains 1 which points to a list that looks like the following: 1->null
